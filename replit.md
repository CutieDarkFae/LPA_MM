# Replit.md

## Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with no existing code structure. The project has not yet been initialized with any specific framework, language, or architecture. This provides a blank slate for development.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

No architectural decisions have been made yet as the repository is empty. When building out this project, consider:

1. **Project Type** - Determine whether this will be a web application, API, CLI tool, or other type of software
2. **Language/Framework** - Select appropriate technologies based on project requirements
3. **Code Organization** - Establish a clear folder structure early on
4. **Data Layer** - If data persistence is needed, choose between SQL databases, NoSQL solutions, or file-based storage

### Recommended Starting Points

When initializing this project:
- Create a clear entry point file (e.g., `index.js`, `main.py`, `app.ts`)
- Set up configuration management for environment variables
- Establish a consistent code style and linting rules
- Add a `.gitignore` file appropriate for the chosen technology stack

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies have been configured yet. When adding dependencies:

1. **Package Management** - Use the appropriate package manager for your language (npm/yarn for Node.js, pip for Python, etc.)
2. **Version Pinning** - Consider pinning dependency versions for reproducible builds
3. **Environment Variables** - Store sensitive credentials (API keys, database URLs) in environment variables, not in code
4. **Database** - If using an ORM like Drizzle, the database connection can be configured later based on project needs
